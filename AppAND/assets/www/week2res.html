				<p>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance) 
				<br/>ANSWER: I believe most of my HTML follows good semantic markup for accessibility. Content is grouped in section tags instead of the generic div tags. One area of improvement would be to add alt tags to my images and also change my li elements for the api content to button for a better clickable area.</p>
				
<p>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?<br/>ANSWER: One of the biggest frustrations I saw was unlabeled forms and misleading links. This is a fairly simple fix by just labeling forms and links appropriately so users know exactly what the form is for and what type of content they will be viewing when they click on a link. A link that states view popular results instead of text that says to view the most popular results and then a link saying click here is easier for a blind user to locate on a page.

<p>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.<br/> ANSWER:iOS(iPhone) has several features to enhance accessibility. The device enables the user to zoom in on content. There is also a feature the inverts colors to make text more readable such as white on black or black on white. The iPad uses a lot of these same features for enhancing accessibility.</p>

<p>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.<br/>ANSWER: iOs has an application called voiceover which uses gestures that allows blind and sighted users to work together. A cursor marks the currently described item, and when the user drags a finger across the trackpad, VoiceOver dims the portion of the screen thatâ€™s not mapped to the trackpad.<br><br>
 
Android has an app called lock rock. It is an eyes free music player in which all controls are based on a eyes-free stroke dialer. You can set Rock Lock as a pre-lock screen for your device to enable quick access to your music collection.</p>
