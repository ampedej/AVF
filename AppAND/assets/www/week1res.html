				<p>Accessing native phone features provides a much more immersed experience for app users.
For example, working with a basic 'To Do' app is probably satisfying for a user. Adding the functionality to optionally snap photographs of 'To Do' items and/or send an email/text of the list to a person in their contacts extends the potential usefulness of the app (and overall enjoyment, user experience, etc.).
Another nice component of some apps is integration with live data. This could come in handy for several scenarios. Some of the obvious ones include weather data, sports data, even social network data. This type of content in apps, when executed purposefully and well, create a more personal and submerged experience for  users.</p>

<p>This week, you're being asked to combine the two. A mash-up, if you will. Small app(s) or app components, that use both Data and Native device feature(s). Maybe a weather app that pulls live weather data, weather-tweets from Twitter and, also allows the user to photograph their own weather-shot (and maybe it saves the photo to their local album and/or uploads to a cloud DB for usage on a social-weather-website...etc...?)</p>

<p>Since we are just beginning the month, now, would be the best time to explore several Data options and all Native device options (if you haven't already) so that you can better prepare for the month.  This week, however, you'll only be required to work with the Data.  This should be plenty for you to do considering I expect clever implementations of the the Data results.  A simple "dump" of Twitter Data will not be as purposeful as a Feature/Search/Browse sort of layout (for example).  Or, maybe your intention is to use the Twitter feed as a small scrolling bit at the bottom of the rest of the Ui.  Certainly up to you but, the execution should be well thought out and you MUST be able to defend your decisions.</p>
